# Single molecule tools

A series of Matlab functions and scripts for [tracking](tracking.md) and quantification of spots in images, [Copy Number deconvolution](deconvolution.md), [segmentation](segmentation.md) and [simulation](simulation.md).

Useful for analysing localisation microscopy, step-wise photobleaching  , STORM, PALM, SHRIMP, FRAP and regular fluorescence microscopy data.

See main function pages for individual tasks ([tracking](tracking.md), [deconvolution](deconvolution.md), [segmentation](segmentation.md) and [simulation](simulation.md)) or head [here](fullGuide.md) for full instructions to analyse step-wise photobleach data.
