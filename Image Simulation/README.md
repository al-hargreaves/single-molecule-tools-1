# Simulation

Simulate diffusing and photobleaching PSFs with 'spotSimulator' or generate a model image of simple cell shaped objects with 3Dshapes.

## 3D shapes

Integrate a model 3D PSF over 3D spheres, cylinders etc. to generate model cell like images.

## Point Spread function

Generate a measured or simulated PSF. This [code](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/31945-widefield-fluorescence-microscope-point-spread-function) will generate a good PSF. Make sure each Z-plane is normalised to unitary intensity and the PSF array is the same size or larger than the image in all 3D.
